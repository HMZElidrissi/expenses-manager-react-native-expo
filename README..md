# Expenses Manager - Expo

I've always wanted to build a mobile app using React Native, and as I have some experience with React, Expo seemed like the perfect gateway. This project was born out of my frustration with existing expense trackers that either did too much for my needs or was too expensive. I wanted something simple, easy to use, and free.

## Features

- Expense Management: Track, categorize, and filter expenses
- Subscription Tracking: Never forget about those sneaky monthly charges again
